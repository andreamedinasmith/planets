Cold and dry, but everything is grand. 

The two mons may be a problem for WOlfman...but what I really want to be 
doing is looking at Ravelry.

Things I want to knit this fall:
- Mom's sweater
- J's vest
- Lots of sock
- Apples


who cares about andreas's projects.....?  Why are they in a collaborative space?


- Allegra's blanket

Here's is the conflict.
